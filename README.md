1.  **Menu Expansion (Pending Categories):** Fully populate the comprehensive JavaScript `menuData` object with items for all remaining planned categories (**Italian, Mexican, and Brazilian**).
2.  **Interactive Checkout (Cart):** Implement the final logic to **calculate the total price in real-time** based on selected items.
3.  **Order Finalization (Button):** Enable the **"Close Order" button** and implement the navigation logic to a final summary screen.
