### üõ†Ô∏è Next on the Menu (The Core Logic)
The development focus is now dedicated to implementing the final purchasing features (e.g., total calculation and the checkout button).

1. **Interactive Checkout (Cart):** Implement the final logic to **calculate the total price in real-time** based on selected items.
2. **Order Finalization (Button):** Enable the **"Close Order" button** and implement the navigation logic to a final summary screen.
