## ðŸš¦ Project Status & Roadmap

ðŸŽ‰ **Project Completed** ðŸŽ‰
The core functionality, including multi-language support, menu display, item selection, real-time total calculation, and seamless WhatsApp ordering, is fully implemented. **However, final mobile responsiveness adjustments are still required.**

## ðŸš€ Future Adjustments & Potential Enhancements

These items represent future development opportunities to evolve the FoodDrop platform:

* **Mobile Responsiveness Finalization:** Although core functionality is complete, the CSS layout requires final adjustments for various mobile screen sizes and orientations to ensure optimal user experience. **(Responsiveness adjustments pending)**.
* **Multiple Units (Quantity Selector):** Currently, the user can only select one item per category (main course, drink, dessert). For a real-world menu, future updates should add **`+` and `-` buttons** to allow for quantities greater than 1 for each selected item.
* **Notes Field (Customization):** Integrate a **free-text input field** within the confirmation modal to allow the customer to add specific observations (e.g., "no ice," "steak doneness," "allergy warnings") before sending the order via WhatsApp.
